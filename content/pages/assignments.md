## Print Project

The print project will include graphics, illustrations, stylized representations, and/or data plots, typeset together with written material(s), on a scientific or engineering topic; and will be printed professionally, e.g., as a brochure or a poster, as well as delivered digitally. This project will provide an opportunity to apply fundamental principles in visual communication, such as use of color, composition, tone, and shape; to develop skills in typography; and to master different graphical formats and techniques. The print project will be executed using primarily Photoshop and Illustrator.

## Animation Project

The animation project will include 2D and/or 3D animation(s) on a scientific or engineering topic, and will be delivered as a movie file. This project provides an opportunity to develop and apply skills for visual storytelling by creating visualizations that involve a change in time. The animation project will be executed using primarily After Effects (2D animation, compositing) and Maya (3D animation). Students may also add live video and/or use other editing software, e.g., Premiere Pro; however the final movie must include at least one animated sequence.

## Interactive Media Project

The interactive media project will include a graphical user interface that allows a user to interact in real time with a 3D scientific or engineering model. This project provides an opportunity to create visualizations in which the audience is an active user rather than only a passive viewer. The interactive media project will be executed using primarily Unity3D (for the graphical interface) and Maya (for the 3D model; students may use the 3D models they create in their animation projects.

During project development, everyone will present their work-in-progress in class and listen to feedback, as well as provide constructive critique to help peers complete their projects. The class will prepare the completed visualizations and choose appropriate format(s) and venue(s) for presentation to a broader audience at the end of the semester.
